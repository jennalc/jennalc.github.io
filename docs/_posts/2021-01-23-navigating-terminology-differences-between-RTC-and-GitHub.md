title: "Navigating Terminology Differences Between RTC and GitHub"
---

Having spent many years using Rational Team Concert (RTC) for all of my source control needs, I have recently dipped my toe into the GitHub world.


One of the major hurdles in making this transition was trying understand where the common source control concepts lay between the two systems. The terminology used by each is entirely different, and in many cases common terms are used in a opposite way. After having spoken to some colleagues who first had experience using GitHub and later came to RTC, the frustrations were the same. Both sides were confused and frustrated. None of us were speaking the same language.


After learning the GitHub vocabulary, the two systems are actually very similar. I hope this rough translation between the two systems can help other developers who may be struggling to move from one to the other.
