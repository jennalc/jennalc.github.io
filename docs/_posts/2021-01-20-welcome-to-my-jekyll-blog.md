This weekend I set out to create a space where I could share thoughts and experiences gained from working in this industry. 
I've created this site is hosted by GitHub Pages, and created using Jekyll. The framework is blog-aware, and allows you to write
content in markdown and have it rendered in a variety of themes provided by jekyll. If you're interested, check out the GitHub documentation at [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/).

I hope you will check out the content as I post it, and that you may find it interesting and useful.

If you'd like to connect, reach out to me on LinkedIn. I'd love to hear from you!
